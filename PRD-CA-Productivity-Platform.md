# ✅ Full PRD: Unified Productivity Platform for Indian CA Firms

**Version**: 1.0  
**Prepared**: August 2025  
**Prepared for**: Internal Engineering & Product Teams

## 1. 💡 Product Vision

Develop a secure, offline-first, unified desktop/web/mobile platform purpose-built for Indian CA firms, incorporating:
- End-to-end task management and workflows (no API dependencies)
- Integrated email communication
- CA-specific document management (local + cloud sync)
- Role-based dashboards
- Unified tagging across all modules
- Apple-grade UI/UX
- Internal collaboration tools (chat, notes)
- Offline working with intelligent sync

This will eliminate fragmented tools (Teams, WhatsApp, Google Drive, Zoho, etc.) and support firms' transformation into scalable, global audit and finance engines.

## 4. ⭐ Key Workflows & Scenarios

| **Use Case** | **Details** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Task Lifecycle** | Partner creates → Manager assigns → Associate executes → Manager marks "Done & Locked" → Task becomes readonly unless re-opened by Partner/Admin |
| **Offline Work** | Intern visits client → fills checklist and uploads documents offline → sync triggers when back online |
| **Email to Task** | Tax notice email from "ABC Ltd" → extract points → create task "Respond to Tax Authority" → auto-tag with `ABC Ltd / FY25` |
| **Document Sync** | Specialist saves Excel in synced folder → auto-uploaded to cloud with version + audit trail → Manager notified for approval |
| **Partner Dashboard** | Sees: Total active clients, compliance completion %, overdue filings, team utilization heatmap |
