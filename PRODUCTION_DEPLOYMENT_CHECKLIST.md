terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"

# 2. Configure Kubernetes cluster
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yaml
```

### **Phase 2: Database Setup (Day 1)**

```bash
# 1. Run database migrations
kubectl exec -it deployment/zetra-app -- npm run db:push

# 2. Seed initial data
kubectl exec -it deployment/zetra-app -- npm run db:seed

# 3. Verify database connectivity
kubectl exec -it deployment/zetra-app -- npm run db:status
```

### **Phase 3: Application Deployment (Day 2)**

```bash
# 1. Build and push Docker image
docker build -t zetra-platform:latest .
docker tag zetra-platform:latest your-registry/zetra-platform:v1.0.0
docker push your-registry/zetra-platform:v1.0.0

# 2. Deploy application
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml

# 3. Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/zetra-app -n production
```

### **Phase 4: Monitoring Setup (Day 2)**

```bash
# 1. Deploy monitoring stack
cd monitoring
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Configure alerts
kubectl apply -f monitoring/alert-rules.yaml

# 3. Setup dashboards
# Import Grafana dashboards from monitoring/dashboards/
```
