# Frontend Implementation Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive design for implementing a modern,
responsive frontend interface for the Zetra CA Platform. The design leverages
the existing robust backend infrastructure while implementing a cohesive
purple-themed design system with enterprise-grade user experience patterns.

## Architecture

### Design System Foundation

The frontend will be built on a consistent design system with the following core
principles:

**Color Palette:**

- Primary Purple: `#7C3AED`
- Dark Purple: `#5B21B6`

- Ultra Light Purple: `#EDE9FE`
- Neutral Grays: `#F9FAFB` to `#111827`

**Typography:**

- Font Family:
  `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif`
- Hierarchical font sizes with consistent line heights
- Font weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold), 800
  (extrabold)

**Spacing System:**

- Base unit: 0.25rem (4px)
- Scale: 0.5rem, 0.75rem, 1rem, 1.25rem, 1.5rem, 2rem, 2.5rem, 3rem, 4rem, 5rem
