# ✅ Zetra PRD: Unified Productivity Platform for Indian CA Firms

**Version**: 1.2  
**Prepared**: August 2025  
**Prepared for**: Internal Engineering & Product Teams

## 1. 💡 Product Vision

Develop a secure, offline-first, unified desktop/web/mobile platform purpose-built for Indian CA firms, delivering:

- End-to-end task management and workflows (no API dependencies),
- Integrated email communication,
- CA-specific document management (local + cloud sync),
- Role-based dashboards,
- Unified tagging across all modules,
- Apple-grade UI/UX,
- Internal collaboration tools (chat, notes),
- Offline functionality with intelligent sync,
- India-specific compliance (ICAI, GST, ROC),
- Flexible client module supporting both individual and business clients.

This platform eliminates fragmented tools (Teams, WhatsApp, Google Drive, Zoho) and transforms CA firms into scalable, globally competitive audit and finance engines.
