# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains all Architectural Decision Records for the Zetra
Platform. ADRs document important architectural and design decisions made during
the development process.

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important
architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They
help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical
context for future changes.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Description of the situation and problem that led to this decision]

## Decision

[The decision that was made]

## Consequences

[Positive and negative consequences of this decision]

## Alternatives Considered

[Other options that were considered and why they were rejected]

## Implementation Notes

[Technical details about implementation]

## Related Decisions

[Links to related ADRs]

## Date

[Date when decision was made]

## Authors

[Who made this decision]
```

## Decision Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- Affect the overall architecture of the system
- Have long-term implications
- Are difficult to reverse
- Involve trade-offs between different approaches
- Set precedents for future decisions

### Decision Making Process

1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize that an architectural decision needs to be
   made
2. **Research Options**: Investigate different approaches and alternatives
3. **Stakeholder Input**: Gather input from relevant team members
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR documenting the decision and rationale
5. **Review Process**: Have the ADR reviewed by technical leads
6. **Implementation**: Implement the decision
7. **Monitor Outcomes**: Track the consequences of the decision

### ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer decision

## ADR Templates

### Standard ADR Template

Use this template for most architectural decisions:

- [Standard ADR Template](./templates/standard-adr-template.md)

### Security ADR Template

Use this template for security-related decisions:

- [Security ADR Template](./templates/security-adr-template.md)

### Performance ADR Template

Use this template for performance-related decisions:

- [Performance ADR Template](./templates/performance-adr-template.md)

## Recent Decisions

### Last 30 Days

- [ADR-021: Microservices Migration Strategy](./ADR-021-microservices-migration.md) -
  _Accepted_
- [ADR-022: Monitoring and Observability](./ADR-022-monitoring-observability.md) -
  _Proposed_

### Under Review

- [ADR-023: Container Orchestration](./ADR-023-container-orchestration.md) -
  _Proposed_
- [ADR-024: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement](./ADR-024-cicd-enhancement.md) -
  _Proposed_

## Decision Impact Analysis

### High Impact Decisions

These decisions have significant impact on the system:

- Technology Stack Selection (ADR-001)
- Database Architecture (ADR-002)
- Authentication Strategy (ADR-003)
- Real-time Communication (ADR-006)

### Dependencies

Track dependencies between decisions:

- ADR-002 depends on ADR-001 (Database choice depends on technology stack)
- ADR-013 depends on ADR-003 (API security depends on authentication strategy)
- ADR-017 depends on ADR-002 (Offline functionality depends on database
  architecture)

## Review Schedule

### Monthly Reviews

- Review all proposed ADRs
- Update status of existing ADRs
- Identify decisions that need to be made

### Quarterly Reviews

- Comprehensive review of all ADRs
- Identify deprecated decisions
- Update consequences based on implementation experience
- Plan for superseding outdated decisions

### Annual Reviews

- Complete audit of all architectural decisions
- Identify patterns and lessons learned
- Update decision-making process based on experience

## Tools and Resources

### ADR Tools

- **ADR CLI**: Command-line tool for managing ADRs
- **ADR Browser**: Web interface for browsing ADRs
- **Decision Matrix**: Tool for comparing alternatives

## Contributing to ADRs

### Creating New ADRs

1. Use the appropriate template
2. Follow the numbering convention (ADR-XXX)
3. Include all required sections
4. Get review from technical leads
5. Update the index when accepted

### Updating Existing ADRs

1. Document what changed and why
2. Update the status if necessary
3. Add implementation notes based on experience
4. Notify stakeholders of significant changes

### Best Practices

- Be specific and concrete in decisions
- Include measurable consequences where possible
- Reference relevant standards and guidelines
- Keep language clear and accessible
- Update regularly based on implementation experience
