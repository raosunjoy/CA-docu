# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Zetra Platform requires a modern, scalable technology stack that can
support:

- Complex CA firm workflows and business logic
- Real-time collaboration features
- Offline-first capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Mobile and web applications
- High performance and scalability requirements

The team needed to select technologies for:

- Frontend framework and libraries
- Backend runtime and framework
- Database systems
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time communication
- File storage and processing
- Development and deployment tools

## Decision

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Build Tool**: Next.js built-in (Webpack/Turbopack)

### Backend Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 LTS
- **Framework**: Next.js API Routes (transitioning to separate services)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js + custom JWT implementation
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Background Jobs**: Bull Queue with Redis

### Database Stack

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Cache**: Redis 7
- **Search**: Elasticsearch 8
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 compatible storage
- **Offline Storage**: SQLite (client-side)

### Infrastructure Stack

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (with multi-cloud compatibility)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Developer Productivity**: TypeScript provides excellent developer
   experience with type safety
2. **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent performance with SSR/SSG
   capabilities
3. **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for React/Node.js
4. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL and Redis provide excellent scalability options
5. **Real-time Capabilities**: Socket.io provides robust real-time communication
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing stack ensures code quality
7. **Modern Standards**: Stack follows current industry best practices

### Negative Consequences

1. **Complexity**: Full-stack TypeScript requires team expertise
2. **Bundle Size**: React applications can have large bundle sizes
3. **Learning Curve**: Some team members may need training on modern React
   patterns
4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Some AWS services create vendor dependencies
5. **Resource Usage**: Node.js can be memory-intensive for certain workloads

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives

1. **Vue.js + Nuxt.js**
   - Pros: Simpler learning curve, excellent documentation
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise adoption
   - Rejected: Team expertise and ecosystem size favored React

2. **Angular**
   - Pros: Enterprise-focused, comprehensive framework
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, verbose syntax
   - Rejected: Development velocity concerns

3. **Svelte/SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, smaller bundle sizes
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise adoption
   - Rejected: Ecosystem maturity concerns

### Backend Alternatives

1. **Express.js**
   - Pros: Lightweight, flexible, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Requires more configuration, less opinionated
   - Rejected: Next.js API routes provide better integration

2. **NestJS**
   - Pros: Enterprise architecture, dependency injection
   - Cons: More complex setup, Angular-like patterns
   - Considered for future microservices migration

3. **Python (Django/FastAPI)**
   - Pros: Excellent for data processing, AI/ML capabilities
   - Cons: Different language from frontend, deployment complexity
   - Rejected: Team expertise and full-stack TypeScript benefits

### Database Alternatives

1. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, good for rapid development
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, complex queries
   - Rejected: ACID compliance requirements for financial data

2. **MySQL**
   - Pros: Familiar to team, good performance
   - Cons: Less advanced features than PostgreSQL
   - Rejected: PostgreSQL's advanced features (JSON, full-text search)

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Continue with current Next.js monolith
2. **Phase 2**: Extract services gradually (authentication, notifications)
3. **Phase 3**: Implement microservices architecture
4. **Phase 4**: Optimize and scale individual services

### Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode for all new code
- Implement comprehensive testing for all features
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Use Prisma migrations for all database changes
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Performance Considerations

- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies at multiple levels
- Monitor performance with Core Web Vitals

### Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
