# Development Workflow

This document outlines the complete development workflow for the Zetra Platform,
from feature conception to production deployment.

## Overview

Our development workflow follows a modified GitFlow approach with emphasis on:

- Feature-driven development
- Continuous integration and testing
- Code quality and security
- Collaborative code review
- Automated deployment

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Planning & Design

#### Feature Planning

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Review feature requirements from product team
2. **Technical Design**: Create technical design document
3. **Architecture Review**: Review with technical leads if needed
4. **Task Breakdown**: Break feature into implementable tasks
5. **Estimation**: Provide time estimates for tasks

#### Design Review Process

- **Small Features**: Peer review with senior developer
- **Medium Features**: Technical lead review required
- **Large Features**: Architecture committee review
- **Cross-cutting Features**: Full team review

### 2. Development Process

#### Branch Strategy

```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/TASK-123-feature-name
├── hotfix/TASK-456-critical-fix
└── release/v1.2.0
```

#### Feature Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**: Branch from `develop`

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/TASK-123-feature-name
   ```

2. **Development Cycle**:
   - Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
   - Implement feature code
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages

3. **Commit Message Format**:

   ```
   type(scope): description

   [optional body]

   [optional footer]
   ```

   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
