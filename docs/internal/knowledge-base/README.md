## Knowledge Management Principles

### 1. Documentation First

- All decisions must be documented before implementation
- Code changes require corresponding documentation updates
- Knowledge should be captured as it's created, not after

### 2. Searchable and Discoverable

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include relevant tags and categories
- Cross-reference related documents
- Maintain a comprehensive index

### 3. Living Documentation

- Documentation is updated as systems evolve
- Regular reviews to ensure accuracy
- Deprecated information is clearly marked
- Version control for all documentation

### 4. Collaborative Maintenance

- All team members contribute to knowledge base
- Peer review for important documentation
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Contribution Guidelines

### Adding New Content

1. **Check Existing Content**: Ensure you're not duplicating information
2. **Use Templates**: Follow established templates for consistency
3. **Include Metadata**: Add creation date, author, and tags
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related documents
5. **Review Process**: Have content reviewed before publishing

### Updating Existing Content

1. **Track Changes**: Document what changed and why
2. **Version History**: Maintain version history for important documents
3. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform relevant team members of changes
4. **Validate Links**: Ensure all links still work after updates

### Content Standards

- **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive, searchable titles
- **Structured Content**: Use consistent headings and formatting
- **Code Examples**: Include relevant code examples where applicable
- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams and screenshots when helpful
- **Regular Updates**: Review and update content regularly

## Search and Discovery

### Search Tips

- Use specific keywords related to your problem
- Search by component, feature, or technology
- Use tags to filter results
- Check both current and archived content

### Content Categories

- **Architecture**: System design and technical architecture
- **Process**: Development and operational processes
- **Standards**: Coding and design standards
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem-solving guides
